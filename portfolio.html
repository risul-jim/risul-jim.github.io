                    I've developed a comprehensive Retail Sales Analysis Dashboard using Excel, offering detailed
                    insights into key performance metrics. This includes Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, Number of
                    Orders, and Profit Margin, represented through Line Graphs. The dashboard features Year-over-Year
                    Growth with color-coded trends, Sales vs. Profit comparisons via Bar Charts, Category-wise Profit
                    with Waterfall Charts, and Category-wise Sales Share in Donut Charts. Sales by State is mapped, and
                    the top 5 sub-categories are highlighted. With interactive filters for Year, Region, and Segment,
                    this tool provides a clear, data-driven approach to retail strategy and decision-making.

                    I have developed an annual sales report dashboard for an e-commerce company using MS Excel. 
                    The project includes detailed sales metrics, such as total sales, total orders, and average sales per order, 
                    alongside insights on gender-based sales performance, order statuses, and monthly trends. The dashboard offers
                     deep analysis of top-performing districts, channel-wise sales, and order behavior by gender and age, with interactive
                      slicers for division and category breakdowns to enhance decision-making and user engagement
